# Turtle-Games-R-Python
Predicting Customer Loyalty and Product Performance with R &amp; Python 

As part of a data analytics consultancy project for Turtle Games, a global game manufacturer and retailer, I explored how customer spending, income, and sentiment influence loyalty and sales performance.
Using advanced analytical techniques in R and Python, including multiple linear regression, decision trees, K-Means clustering and Natural Language Processing - I built predictive models, customer segments, and sentiment analyses to uncover the key behavioural drivers behind loyalty and purchasing trends.

**Key objectives:**
- Predict customer loyalty using regression and machine learning models.
- Identify distinct customer segments through clustering analysis.
- Analyse customer reviews with NLP sentiment models (VADER and TextBlob).
- Combine sentiment and sales proxies to evaluate product-level performance.

**Key outcomes:**
- Income and spending behaviour were confirmed as the strongest predictors of loyalty.
- Five clear customer segments were identified to guide targeted marketing strategies.
- Review-based sentiment proved far more reliable than short summaries for brand insights.
- Developed a product sentimentâ€“sales framework to prioritise promotions, quality improvements, and supply decisions.

This project showcases my ability to apply predictive modelling, segmentation, and text analytics to deliver clear, data-driven recommendations for business growth.
